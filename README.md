# Reddit.js

Reddit clone project built at Make School.

## About Reddit.js

This project is a clone of the popular forum website Reddit built for Back-End Web 1.2 at Make School. This version of Reddit is built using MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js and Handlebars.js. Additional styling is done in Bootstrap.

### Concepts

I explore concepts such as user-centered development (used a views focused design process) and best practices in technical planning. After reviewing basic concepts in routing and database integration, I am implementing testing with Mocha.js and Chai.js to promote good overall development practices and catch edge cases.

New concepts in this project included authentication patterns and making resourceful login, sign-up and logout routes and users with their posts. JSON web tokens are used to this end.

### Running

This app can be run from the command line using the command "nodemon". It is hosted on port https://localhost:3000.

### Testing

Automated testing is integrated using Mocha and Chai. You can run tests using the command "mocha".
